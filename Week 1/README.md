Each folder contains the socket program for the respective entity
To run the programs, Server and Data Owner must be executed first and then the Query User should be run
After completion of one execution, the query user is terminated but the server and data owner programs are still running.
This allows for sequential query handling by running the query user program again
To end the run, Data Owner and Server must be manually terminated.
All files should be executed in independant terminal windows
