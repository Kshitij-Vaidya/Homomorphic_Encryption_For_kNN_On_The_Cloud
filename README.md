# SoC_Project_Kshitij

This is a self project under the Summer of Code Programme conducted by WNCC IIT Bombay. The topic of the project is : Homomorphic Encyrption of K-NN on the Cloud. The project starts with an introduction to Socket Programming. Socket is an in-built Python library and is used to establish connections between ports.

The second week introduces Sagemath, a powerful library containing multiple math function that greatly ease the complex mathematical computations involved in cryptographic applications. The third week introduces the most popular cryptography methods : RSA, ElGamal and Paillier. The assignment involved creating python/sagemath classes for the encryption and decryption using these cryptography methods

The fourth week provides an introduction to Docker. It is a platform designed to simplify the process of creating, deploying, and running applications inside lightweight, portable, and isolated containers. In this week, we deploy the cloud server using a Docker Container and perform the same operations done in the first week.

The Final Project is a cumulation of all the previous assignments. It is the implementation of a research paper on Homomorphic Encryption of k-NN on the Cloud. The cloud server is deployed using Docker and the query sent by a user is resolved by the data owner and cloud server.
